# Time Table Scheduler

 The lecture-timetablescheduling is a Constraint satisfaction problem in which we find a solution that satisfies thegiven set of constraints.

We have overcome the above problem by designing  a lecture scheduling software which caters to the needs of our institute.  The software has been designed keeping the end user in mind as we have provided the functionality of drag and drop that enables one to simply drag slots to predefined slots as long as it defines certain constraints. For example, the same classroom cannot be occupied by different batches.
